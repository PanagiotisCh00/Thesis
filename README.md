# Thesis
Contains my thesis of my undergraduate degree in University of Cyprus. Its title is “ Feature Selection and Training of Neural Networks to Classify Functional Versus Dysfunctional Coping with Acute Pain”. I provide the abstract of the paper:

During the last years, there has been a rapid development of both wearable technologies
and Artificial Intelligence, especially the part of Machine learning. A lot of different
studies were conducted by the Department of Computer Science and Department of
Psychology of University of Cyprus that use traditional machine learning algorithms to
classify people as functional or dysfunctional coping with acute pain. These algorithms
use data collected from an experiment in which the participants were asked to immerse
their hands into an ice water container. The signals collected are psychophysiological
signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and facial
electromyography (fEMG).
The main aim of this study is to substitute these traditional machine learning algorithms
with Neural Networks (NN) as they have become popular the last years.
Firstly, a study and a classification of Neural Networks takes place and how they have
been used in the past in related studies. Based on the study, we have identified several
NNs to be used, namely MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF),
SelfOrganizing Map of Kohonen, the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and a
combination of the MLP, RBF and LSTM. The same feature selection is followed as in
the other study because it is generic, and it seems to be working with NN as well. Different
data multiplication techniques are used to multiply the dataset like the Rectangular
Window Methodology and the Moving Window Methodology and different activation
functions are used in the NNs. The Best NN is the RBF with Tanh activation function
in the Moving Window Methodology, yielding similar results when compared to the
ones obtained by the traditional machine learning algorithms.
Finally, another experiment is considered where people are classified again as functional
or dysfunctional, but the data is collected in real time via a wearable device. The data are
similar to the previous experiment and the best NN algorithm is a MultiLayer
Perceptron, achieving very similar results to the ones obtained by the traditional machine
learning algorithms.

As an overall contribution, a more generic methodology is introduced on how to “replace”
the traditional Machine Learning algorithms with Neural Networks.
